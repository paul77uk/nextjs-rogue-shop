      "Rogue's standard Strongman™ Sandbags deliver a versatile, go-anywhere alternative to heavy balls and immobile Atlas stones. Made in America, they feature the same 1000D MIL Spec US Cordura construction and reinforced, double-stitched seams as our  full length 2.0 Sandbags—in a more compact, cylindrical form. We also offer these bags in several other color options and shape variations, including the Cyclone Strongman Bag (tapered with a wider diameter at the top of the bag), the 'Cube,' the rectangular 'Block,' and the long and narrow 'Tombstone;' and the patented Husafell edition, all sold separately. Ranging in weight capacity from 25LB up to 400LB, the standard Strongman Sandbag comes with a built-in filler bag + an additional zipper and hook-and-loop closure—ensuring filler material stays fully contained as you work through your regimen (the filler material itself is not included). Because the bags can be emptied and then re-filled at another gym, field, beach, park, etc., they function as uniquely portable Strongman training tools for athletes of any experience level",

      "Rogue's exclusive Husafell Strongman Sandbags are another addition to our line-up of funnel-filled, portable sandbags for strongman training (see also: the 'Cube,' the 'Block,' the 'Cyclone,' the 'Tombstone,' and the original cylindrical model). This patented design is inspired by and named after the famous Icelandic lifting stone (as seen in the Rogue documentary FULLSTERKUR). Available in three size options, each Husafell Sandbag is made in America from 1000D MIL Spec Cordura with reinforced, double-stitched seams. The back and side panels feature the same special grabber fabric used on our Thompson Fat Pad, providing additional stick/grip for carrying. To add sand (not provided), athletes can simply use the built-in hook-and-loop funnel filler, which folds into a zipper closure covered by another hook-and-loop flap for triple protection against leaks. While other Husafell Stone replicas have been produced for strongman training, most are made from unforgiving materials that can lead to injury if not dropped carefully. This customizable sandbag interpretation of the Husafell's shape allows Strongmen & Strongwomen to get a similar training experience without risk of injuring a foot or damaging their training surface on a drop. Because the sandbags can be emptied and then re-filled at another gym, field, beach, park, etc., they're also far more transportable than an actual lifting stone.",

      "The Rogue Echo Bike combines heavy-duty steel, precision engineering, and convenient customization to forge a stronger, sturdier fan bike. Weighing in at 123 LBS, Version 3.0 of the Echo Bike provides the same rock solid foundation and convenient portability as the prior model, with the addition of several design upgrades. This includes an improved LCD console that not only tracks intervals, distance, calories burned, heart rate, and more, but also now features Bluetooth / ANT+ compatibility, allowing users to connect to various cycling apps for even more performance feedback. The bike's quiet, belt-driven steel fan blade produces a smooth, consistent ride, and a re-positioned seat adjustment knob enables quick changes between different athletes with no snags or interference. A customized Version 3.0 Wind Guard is also available as an optional add-on, now updated with a more streamlined, low-profile design.",

      "Developed for the 2021 Rogue Invitational, the JC-100S Jerry Can Sandbag is a new variation on a classic military design. Rather than using metal or HDPE (as in our JC-40 Jerry Can),this American-made model features a durable 1000D military-grade Cordura construction and a 500D coated-nylon interior liner, all supported by triple-seam stitching and reinforced binding for max structural integrity. These sandbags are more space efficient than traditional jerricans, while still offering substantial load capacities of approximately 100 LBS of sand or 40 LBs of crumb rubber. Each JC-100S Jerry Can includes a built-in funnel filler design for quick loading of filler material (not included) with a secure Velcro closure and a polyurethane-reinforced YKK #10 zipper to prevent leaks. The silent zipper also tucks into a built-in pocket to help keep the slide stationary and the user's hands free from abrasion. The heavy-duty handles are built with American-made 1.5' nylon webbing, and stitched with vinyl backed, reinforced 'X' box tacks. One handle includes a 5' PVC tube, providing additional comfort under heavy loads. A 1000D Cordua + Velcro wrap can be used to join the handles, creating a single 5” grip that's well suited for balancing and carrying heavy loads.",
